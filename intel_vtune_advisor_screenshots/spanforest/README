The VTune profile for spanning forest shows that the CPU utilization
of the program is low. It reports hotspots that belong to libc and the
spanning forest application. It regions that belong to the application
correspond to two parallel_fors and one serial section. But further
parallelizing there regions did not increase the speedup of the
program.
