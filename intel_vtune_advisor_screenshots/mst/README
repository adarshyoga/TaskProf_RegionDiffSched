The profile generated by VTune for minimum spanning tree highlights
two parallel_for regions and code sections in libc as the bottlenecks
in the program. Further these bottlenecks have high task scheduling
overhead. But these parallel_for regions already have sufficient
parallelism; increasing their parallelism did not improve the speedup.
