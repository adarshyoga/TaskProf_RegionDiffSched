The VTune profile for nbody shows that the program has good cpu
utilization, but high task scheduling overhead. The task scheduling
overhead is attributed to TBB scheduler internals in the TBB
runtime. VTune also highlights a serial section in "direct"
function. But this is not the serial section that we optimized to
improve the parallelism.
