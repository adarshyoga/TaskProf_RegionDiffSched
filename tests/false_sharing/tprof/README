The "par_small_array.cpp" contains the example with false sharing. The "par_small_array_padded.cpp" contains the example with false sharing resolved using padding.

Running make compiles both version.

1) Run example with false sharing with TaskProf. First run with 1 thread.
   > ./par_small_array 1

2) To perform differential analyis TaskProf expects the logs for 1-thread version in "step_nodes_serial" directory.
   > mv *.csv step_nodes_serial/

3) Run 16 thread version.
   > ./par_small_array 16

4) Now run TaskProf analysis tool.
   > $TP_GENPROF/gentprof
The differential profile will be generated in step_diff_file.csv.
